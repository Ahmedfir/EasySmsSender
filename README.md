# EasySmsSender
Easy Sms Sender allows you to write an SMS to a selected local user.
These features were implemented:
+ An asynchronous loading of the local contacts with sorting and removal of the duplicates.
+ A costum search view with automatic search triggered when tapping on the key board.
+ A local users list sorted by alphabetic order with alphabetic dividers.
+ A cache system of search history to improve the search performance.
+ An asynchronous Sms sender with a queue. The sending and delivery of the SMS status is tracked by BroadcastReceivers.  Toasts are shown with success or failure messages.
